The purpose of this project is to find out the ip address of a VM managed by
ovirt/RHEV. The VM must have rhev-agent (or ovirt-agent) installed
beforehand.

You will need to provide the username, password, ovirt truststore,
rhev/ovirt server api link, and the cluster name of the RHEV/OVirt vm.

The OVirt-Java SDK is being used in this case.
